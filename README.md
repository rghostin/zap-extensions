Hi everyone, I think we should have some communication ways other than github.

Which one do you prefer?
A. Discord
B. Whats app
C. Facebook
D. others

Just edit this readme file, we shall remove it after we set up communication


Hi this is Deniz. Whatsapp might initially be the easiest platform to communicate effectively. My phone number is +32 494 17 86 99. I am also on facebook.

Hello, I think Discord would the most suited, given that we eventually might need to share code, files or livestream the screen, etc. We could keep it all centralized in several channels. I'm also on whatsapp +32 477 53 10 08 - Rawad

# Group17

Hi everyone, I think we should have some communication ways other than github.

Which one do you prefer?
A. Discord
B. Whats app
C. Facebook
D. others

Just edit this readme file, we shall remove it after we set up communication


Hi this is Deniz. Whatsapp might initially be the easiest platform to communicate effectively. My phone number is +32 494 17 86 99. I am also on facebook.

Hello, I think Discord would the most suited, given that we eventually might need to share code, files or livestream the screen, etc. We could keep it all centralized in several channels. I'm also on whatsapp +32 477 53 10 08 - Rawad


Hello, I am Olympia. We can use initially the whats up application and later if we want to share files and see that it is not convenient we can find another way. My phone number is +30 6976902403 - Olympia. I am also on Facebook if you want to form a group. Furthermore we could use Skype.


Hi, I just created a whatsapp group so that we can set a call to decide where to start project. You can join via:

Was any of us able to contact Xinhai, he seems to be not enrolled at CW-OSS so far? Or maybe I was not able to see him on the members list. -Deniz

I sent him a mail, waiting for his input. - Rawad

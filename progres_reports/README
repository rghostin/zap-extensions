PROGRESS REPORTS FOLDER

In this folder, store your weekly progress reports.  Use following file name convention:

    progress_report_group_xx_week_yy.txt

where xx is your group number (e.g. 03) and yy is the ISO week date number as defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date
The week starting Monday, October 16th 2017 is week 42. Next week is week 43 etc...
The format of the progress reports is free form. You do not need to use the raw txt format. 
If you prefer, you can make it a .docx, .rtf, .pdf file or anything mainstream enough for us 
to be able to open the document on all major general purpose operating systems.
